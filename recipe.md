Step One: Measure out your ingredients.
Macarons don’t have to be hard, but you do have to be pretty precise in your preparation. We like to measure out all our ingredients using our kitchen scale before getting started to prevent messing up any measurements once you get started.
Step Two: Sift together the powdered sugar and almond flour three times to get out any clumps that would cause air bubbles or lumpy macarons.
*You can also pulse your powdered sugar and almond flour in a food processor, but as long as you sift it very well, there’s no need to break out another appliance.
Step Three: Whisk egg whites and roughly 3 tablespoons of the granulated sugar continuously until sugar melts completely and egg whites become white and frothy
Step Four: Transfer the egg whites to a stand mixer and slowly add the remaining granulated sugar, beating on high speed until stiff peaks form and the mixture is glossy. If using food coloring add here as well! 
You’ll know it’s done when the mixture is not longer grainy when you rub it between your fingers.
Step Five: Add the sifted powdered sugar and almond flour to the egg whites. Turn the mixer to medium speed and whisk for 5 seconds.
Step Six: Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the bowl and gently fold the batter from the outside of the bowl and gently twisting it into the center in a circle-like manner.
Do this until the batter is a lava like consistency and you can make a figure 8 with the batter without it breaking.
Step Seven: Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fit with a ½ inch tip. Pipe the macarons out a few inches apart onto two cookies sheets lined with parchment paper.
Step Eight: Bake the macarons at 300°F for 13 to 15 minutes (depending on the size).
Step Nine: Allow the macarons to cool completely before transferring to a cooling rack.
Step Ten: While the macarons cool, make the filling. Combine all the filling ingredients together in a bowl and beat until fluffy and creamy.
Step Eleven: Once the macarons are completely cool, sandwich together with the filling.
Step Twelve: Devour!
